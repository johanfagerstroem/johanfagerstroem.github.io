      <description>Introduction Following up on the post I wrote on using using virtual smartcards (in the shape of Yubikeys) in Firefox for secure hardware-backed client certificate authentication. There is now a way to configure Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge on Linux to support the same workflow.
Both Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge are based on Chromium, which under the hood makes use of Mozilla NSS (libnss) for network communication. NSS does have support for PKCS11 modules, and can easily be configured with the official PKCS11 module from Yubico as described in the previous post.</description>

      <description>Introduction tl;dr This post covers setting up Caddy as a reverse proxy, and configure it to perform client certificate validation (a.k.a. mTLS). In addition to this, the post covers storing the client certificate and the private key securely on a Yubikey (acting as a virtual PIV smart card).
I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to find a similar quickstart tutorial on the internet, therefore I&amp;rsquo;m writing this one. I have absolutely zero affiliation with Yubico or Caddy; I just enjoy mucking about with their products and tools as they are really one step closer to ItJustWorks(TM) than several other solutions.</description>
