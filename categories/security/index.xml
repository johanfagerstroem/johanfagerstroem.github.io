      <description>Introduction tl;dr This post covers setting up Caddy as a reverse proxy, and configure it to perform client certificate validation (a.k.a. mTLS). In addition to this, the post covers storing the client certificate and the private key securely on a Yubikey (acting as a virtual PIV smart card).
I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to find a similar quickstart tutorial on the internet, therefore I&amp;rsquo;m writing this one. I have absolutely zero affiliation with Yubico or Caddy; I just enjoy mucking about with their products and tools as they are really one step closer to ItJustWorks(TM) than several other solutions.</description>
